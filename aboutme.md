My name is Yue Wu, a lecturer in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow. My research interest include:

- Numerical analysis for stochastic (partial) differential equations (see [talk slides given at MCQMC 2018](http://mcqmc2018.inria.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MCQMCTalkWU.pdf))
- Random periodic solutions of stochastic (partial) differential equations and its numercs (watch [my talk given at GPSD 2021 mannheim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuWu-p2DFn8&t=1s))
- Rough path theory and its applications in machine learning/data science 

I am the co-orginazer of Data Science for Mental Health interest group Alan Turing Institute, the past events can be found in [DS4MH](https://turing-ds4mh.github.io/).

I am now writting a book on the theory of rough paths with [Terry Lyons](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/terry.lyons), [Hao Ni](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=HNIXX56), and [Danyu Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=p_0YU4cAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&alert_preview_top_rm=2&sortby=pubdate).
